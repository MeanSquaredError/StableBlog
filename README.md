# StableBlog

This is a repository containing TeX vesions of articles in [my blog](https://blog.sigfpe.com).
My hope is that links to this repo will have more longevity than links to [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com).

I've made light edits, mainly to eliminate overfull hboxes and to make sure code compiles with GHC.
I've left in material that may seem a little dated now.
